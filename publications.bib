Admissions practices for courses in two institutions offering tertiary and higher education demonstrate how the official rules of the game shape the experience of students moving into and through HE on vocational and alternative routes. These examples suggest that rules created for the `selective' part of the HE field can have perverse effects on other parts of the field, creating barriers rather than bridges for students seeking to participate in HE via alternative routes. The paper concludes by considering the strengths and limitations of using Bourdieu's tools for understanding diversification in HE. Does using Bourdieu lead to the inevitable conclusion that diversity is a form of diversion, directing a proportion of the population through an easily accessible, but ultimately less rewarding path, or can Bourdieu's tools suggest possibilities for transformation and change?},

  abstract = {L'absence de fili{\`e}res d'excellence {\'e}litaire distingue la Su{\`e}de de presque tous les autres pays. Il n'y a, dans l'enseignement sup{\'e}rieur, quasi aucune institution qui se distingue des autres par un recrutement d'{\'e}tudiants d'origine sociale exceptionnellement {\'e}lev{\'e}e ou ayant des r{\'e}f{\'e}rences scolaires brillantes. Aucun frais de scolarit{\'e} n'est per{\c c}u {\`a} quelque niveau que ce soit du syst{\`e}me {\'e}ducatif, et des bourses d'{\'e}tudes et des pr{\^e}ts sont allou{\'e}s {\`a} tous les {\'e}tudiants su{\'e}dois -- ce qui creuserait une ligne de partage fond{\'e}e sur l'{\'e}conomie. Pratiquement toutes les institutions d'enseignement sup{\'e}rieur {\'e}tant publiques, l'opposition entre priv{\'e} et public est non pertinente. De plus, aux niveaux inf{\'e}rieurs du syst{\`e}me su{\'e}dois il n'existe que tr{\`e}s peu d'{\'e}coles ou de voies institutionnelles o{\`u} l'on puisse percevoir facilement la pr{\'e}{\'e}minence des enfants des actuelles {\'e}lites ou qui soient consacr{\'e}es {\`a} la s{\'e}lection et {\`a} la formation des {\'e}lites futures. Ainsi, pour comprendre le r{\^o}le de l'enseignement dans la reproduction et la production des {\'e}lites su{\'e}doises, n'est-il pas possible de diff{\'e}rencier un secteur sp{\'e}cifique d'institutions {\'e}litaires. Il faut, au contraire, prendre en compte l'ensemble du syst{\`e}me. Cet article propose d'analyser l'{\'e}ducation de l'{\'e}lite comme un sousespace de l'espace de l'enseignement sup{\'e}rieur su{\'e}dois dans son entier, caract{\'e}ris{\'e} par une distribution in{\'e}gale de diff{\'e}rents types de capitaux. Cette perspective tient compte de la distinction entre {\'e}lites et membres de la classe sociale sup{\'e}rieure, aussi bien que des distinctions entre les diff{\'e}rents types de capitaux -- h{\'e}rit{\'e}s et acquis -- qu'ils soient {\'e}conomiques, sociaux, culturels ou {\'e}ducatifs. Nous tenons pour centrale la distribution de ces capitaux entre hommes et femmes, puisque ces derni{\`e}res ont tendance {\`a} surclasser de plus en plus les premiers. Il est {\'e}galement notable que dans un pays p{\'e}riph{\'e}rique comme la Su{\`e}de les investissements {\'e}ducatifs dans des ressources transnationales soient d'une importance cruciale et croissante, tant pour les {\'e}tudiants que pour les institutions. Une des principales conclusions est que le syst{\`e}me {\'e}ducatif su{\'e}dois est en cours de diff{\'e}renciation et n'est ainsi plus autant une singularit{\'e} par rapport au reste du monde. The absence of a clear-cut elite education sector distinguishes Sweden from nearly all other countries. In higher education, almost no institutions rise in their entirety above the rest when it comes to recruitment of students of exceptional high social origin or superior scholarly credentials. Tuition fees are not allowed at any level and study grants and loans are provided to all Swedish students, undermining an economic driven divide of the system. Since virtually all higher education institutions are public, the opposition between private and public is inconsequential. In addition, at lower levels of the Swedish system there exist very few easily discernible schools or institutional tracks dominated by the offspring of current elites or dedicated to the selection and formation of future elites. Thus, in order to understand the role of education in the reproduction and production of Swedish elites, it is not possible to distinguish a separate sector of elite institutions. Instead, the entire system must be taken into account. This article proposes to analyse elite education as a subspace within the whole space of Swedish higher education, defined by the uneven distribution of various species of capital. This perspective allows for the distinction between elites and members of the upper class as well as distinctions between different species of capital -- inherited and acquired -- including economic, social, cultural and educational. We find the distribution of capital among men and women crucial since the latter tend to increasingly outperform the former. It is also noteworthy that in a peripheral country such as Sweden educational investments in transnational resources are of crucial and growing importance, for students as well as for institutions. A main conclusion is that the Swedish educational system is subjected to an on-going differentiation and thus represents less of an exception in relation to the rest of the world.},

Often the tone is critical usually focused on the subjective aspects of the process; e.g., the list of the universities' attributes used in the rankings, their respective weights, and the size and composition of the comparison group. These aspects of a ranking are an easy target since, after all, they are based on someone's opinion even if this person is considered an expert. There are other, purely technical, reasons why ranking schemes are problematic. In this paper we discuss these aspects of rankings by studying the handling of the data, exposing logical mistakes, and raising interpretation issues. We present these as a list of four ``pitfalls'' invoking in each case an example from an actual rankings. Each case also results in recommendations that address the technical issues involved.},

Yet, despite the influence of his work, no single introduction to his wide-ranging oeuvre is available. This book, intended for an English-speaking audience, offers a systematic and accessible overview, providing interpretive keys to the internal logic of Bourdieu's work by explicating thematic and methodological principles underlying his work. The structure of Bourdieu's theory of knowledge, practice, and society is first dissected by Loic Wacquant; he then collaborates with Bourdieu in a dialogue in which they discuss central concepts of Bourdieu's work, confront the main objections and criticisms his work has met, and outline Bourdieu's views of the relation of sociology to philosophy, economics, history, and politics. The final section captures Bourdieu in action in the seminar room as he addresses the topic of how to practice the craft of reflexive sociology. Throughout, they stress Bourdieu's emphasis on reflexivity---his inclusion of a theory of intellectual practice as an integral component of a theory of society---and on method---particularly his manner of posing problems that permits a transfer of knowledge from one area of inquiry into another. Amplified by notes and an extensive bibliography, this synthetic view is essential reading for both students and advanced scholars.},

  abstract = {A synthesis of forty years' work by France's leading sociologist, this book pushes the critique of scholarly reason to a new level. It is a brilliant example of Bourdieu's unique ability to link sociological theory, historical information, and philosophical thought.Pascalian Meditations makes explicit the presuppositions of a state of "scholasticism," a certain leisure liberated from the urgencies of the world. Philosophers, unwilling to engage these presuppositions in their practice, have brought them into the order of discourse, not so much to analyze them as to legitimate them. This situation is the primary systematic, epistemological, ethical, and aesthetic error that Bourdieu subjects to methodological critique.This critique of scholarly reason is carried out in the name of Pascal because he, too, pointed out the features of human existence that the scholastic outlook ignores: he was concerned with symbolic power; he refused the temptation of foundationalist thinking; he attended (without populist na{\"i}vet{\'e}) to "ordinary people"; and he was determined to seek the raison d'{\^e}tre of seemingly illogical behavior rather than condemning or mocking it.Through this critique, Bourdieu charts a negative philosophy that calls into question some of our most fundamental presuppositions, such as a "subject" who is free and self-aware.

  abstract = {This is the third of five volumes based on the lectures given by Pierre Bourdieu at the~Coll{\'e}ge de France in the early 1980s under the title~General Sociology. In these lectures, Bourdieu sets out to define and defend sociology as an intellectual discipline; in doing so he introduces and clarifies all the key concepts for which he has become so well known, concepts that continue to shape the way that sociology is practised today.In this volume, Bourdieu focuses on one of these key concepts, capital, which forms part of the trilogy of concepts -- habitus, capital, field -- that define the core of his theoretical approach. A field, as a social space of relatively durable relations between agents and institutions, is also a site of specific investments, which presupposes the possession of specific forms of capital and secures both material and symbolic profits. While there are many different forms of capital, two are fundamental and effective in all social fields: economic capital and cultural capital. These and other forms of capital exist only in relation to the fields in which they are deployed: the distribution of the forms and quantities of capital constitutes the structure of the field within which agents act and they confer power over the field, over the mechanisms that define the functioning of the field and over the profits engendered in the field -- over, for example, the transmission of cultural capital in the educational system.An ideal introduction to one of Bourdieu's most important concepts, this volume will be of great interest to the many students and scholars who study and use Bourdieu's work across the social sciences and humanities, and to general readers who want to know more about the work of one of the most important sociologists and social thinkers of the twentieth century.},

  abstract = {The dramatic salience of university rankings is usually attributed to a number of macro-level trends, such as neoliberal ideology, the spread of audit culture, and globalization in the broadest sense. We propose that the institutionalization of university rankings cannot be fully accounted for without a better understanding of the meso-level processes that enable it. To explore these, we zoom in on an organization called IREG Observatory (whereby IREG stands for `International Ranking Expert Group'). Since it first emerged, in 2002, IREG has acted as a carrier of a kind of rationalized `faith in rankings'---a faith it has laboured to justify, diffuse, and solidify through boundary work at the intersection of technocratic, managerial, academic, and commercial spheres. Drawing on the insights gained from this particular case, the article argues that the institutionalization of university rankings is not solely a matter of universities being impelled by them but also a matter of how actors in and around the university sector collectively partake in the legitimation of the practice of ranking universities. At a more general level, our analysis potentially provides a blueprint for understanding boundary work as a meso-level process that plays an important role in the institutionalization of rankings, and other devices of evaluation.},

Starting from the premise that a global field is not a national field writ large, this paper discusses strategies and elements for revising field theory for use beyond national borders. Specifically, the article first proposes analogical theorizing as a systematic approach for extending and modifying the tools of field theory at a global level. Analogical theorizing offers a method for constructing the object in a global context in a way that goes beyond rescaling and minimizes the risk of deductive reification. Against this background and drawing from research on the global visual art field, the article offers criteria for delineating a global field and distinguishes relative functional and vertical autonomy. Finally, it discusses how the concept of `relative vertical autonomy' contributes in three ways to the development of global field analysis: for theorizing emergence; examining global-national interdependencies; and denationalizing Bourdieu's concept of `national capital'.},

This system was designed to increase educational equity by changing the previous school admission ``rules'' that were prejudicial against low-income students. We use Bourdieu's conceptual tools, drawing on concepts of capitals and field, to analyse the influence of the new rules of the game on the value of middle-class capitals. To understand how the new rules shape middle-class families'advantages, we link qualitative and quantitative analyses that empirically explore how families subjectively interpret the policy change and how objectively it shapes their access to desired schools. The qualitative phase shows that middle-class parents experience the NSAS as a risky new scenario. However, quantitative analysis shows the NSAS is associated with only a modest decrease in middle class-advantages. We illustrate the difficulty of transforming marketized educational systems, where previously privileged families react against equity-driven changes.},

This article develops two possibilities: (1) positional advantage, where rankings increase demand for better-ranked organizations and crowd out disadvantaged individuals; and (2) algorithmic trade-offs, where rankings lead organizations to optimize on criteria that are in tension with serving individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds. Scope conditions for these theories are established, and key predictions are tested with administrative data matched with U.S. News \& World Report college rankings between 1997 and 2015. This research clarifies how the consequences of ranking systems spill over from organizations to broader social inequalities and demonstrates when and how rankings contribute to structural barriers to upward mobility.},

A recent UNESCO/CEPES conference on higher education indicators concluded that cross-national research on these ranking systems could make an important contribution to improving the international market for higher education. The comparison and analysis of national university ranking systems can help address a number of important policy questions. First, is there an emerging international consensus on the measurement of academic quality as reflected in these ranking systems? Second, what impact are the different ranking systems having on university and academic behavior in their respective countries? Finally, are there important public interests that are thus far not reflected in these rankings? If so, is there a needed and appropriate role for public policy in the development and distribution of university ranking systems and what might that role be? This paper explores these questions through a comparative analysis of university rankings in Australia, Canada, the UK, and the US.},

Second, I analyze the International Baccalaureate Organization, a large non-profit provider of accreditation for schools, as a case for conceptualizing a global field of `international education.' My ethnographic and historical findings provide the background for the global field argument. Second, drawing on IBO's student data, I construct a geometric space of IB schools and analyze it as a relatively autonomous subfield. Finally, I show how combining field analysis and geometric modeling yields a new perspective on `international education.'},

It analyses access by young people to higher education from four perspectives: funding type (public/private), gender, family income level, and ethnicity. The study uses descriptive data, primarily from the CASEN and Higher Education Information System (SIES) databases. Access to higher education in Chile has exploded in recent decades, largely because of private institutions, which currently enrol two thirds of higher education students, and offer them courses that are often irrelevant and of low quality. In contrast, in the early 1980s, the private sector enrolled under 30\% of students. The study also found a gradual increase in the enrolment of females, of students from the least wealthy families, and of ethnic minorities, although the inequality gap persists, especially at the more prestigious private and public universities.},

Research in industrialized countries has shown that the path students follow in their transition from secondary school continues to be associated with their social class. This study provides quantitative evidence of that relationship in a non-industrial country like Chile. Multinomial logistic and linear regression of university admission data managed by the Department of Evaluation, Measurement and Registration describing 130,000 applicants for the years 2015 and 2017 were used to estimate the probability of a member of a particular social class choosing a given university and academic field of study. The results show differences regarding law programs and science, technology, engineering and mathematics programs. Class differences were particularly important in the choice of university. Working-class students were more likely to apply to public universities, avoiding elite and especially private institutions. The findings provide further support for Bourdieu's habitus explanation of class reproduction. They suggest more attention to the level of segregation in Chilean higher education and the factors that produce it.},

Aggregating general correspondences in electronic format offers a global portrait of the evolving composition of the intellectual and scientific scene, its changing foci of interests and the fortune of the intellectual discussions as expressed in cited persons in the letters. Such tools help replace a purely metaphoric use of the term ``network'' by a visible map of the intellectual relations between people on which well defined calculations of the centrality of the positions of different actors can be made as well as their evolution over time. These techniques provide welcome additions to the tool kit of scholars in an age where the computer and the web offer new ways of mapping and mining the rich store of information contained in intellectual correspondences.},

  abstract = {The historiography of the Spanish transition to democracy is going through exciting times. After years in which the importance of civic organizations has been relatively downplayed, we are witnessing a growing interest in their contribution to the process. The most important foci of social resistance to the dictatorship were the workers' organizations, the student and nationalist movements. They contributed to the regime's destabilization and pressured Franco's successors to move towards liberalization. Nevertheless, this article argues that examining everyday areas of cultural practices reveals that social mobilization in Spain in the 1970s was more extensive than currently believed and had interesting cultural consequences in important social sectors. By analyzing the movements for pedagogical renovation, the article shows the intensity of a cultural campaign to influence the country's future that was carried out in the workplace. Within a framework that sees democratization as a process of mutual transformation of state and society, this piece explores the channels through which these movements contributed to the transformation of Spain from an authoritarian society controlled by a dictatorial state to a pluralistic polity sustaining democratic procedures. The movements for pedagogical renovation initiated a quiet, yet determined endeavour to modify workplace practices and procedures in order to ensure the democratization of the everyday lives of citizens. If, from the outside, it seemed the Spanish public was not actively involved in bringing about Spanish democracy, entering the classrooms reveals the struggle was at its height.},

According to prevalent discourse, science is insufficiently productive and in need of stricter governance and bureaucratic management, with performance evaluation by the means of quantitative metrics as a key tool to increase efficiency. The basis of this notion appears to be a belief that the key or only purpose of science is to drive economic growth, or sustainable development in combination with economic growth. In this article, these beliefs are analyzed and deconstructed with the help of a theoretical toolbox from the classic sociology of science and recent conceptualizations of economization, democratization, and commodification of scientific knowledge and the institution of science, connecting these beliefs to broader themes of market fundamentalism and to the metric fixation of current society. With the help of a historical-sociological analysis, this article shows that the current ubiquity of performance evaluation in science for the most part is pointless and counterproductive, and that this state of science policy is in dire need of reevaluation in order to secure science's continued productivity and contribution to social and technological innovation.},

Symptoms of stratification are documented by the distribution of memberships in assessment panels, of research active staff, and of external research grants. Symptoms of a standardization are documented by the publications submitted to the assessments. The main finding is that the RAEs/REF and the selective allocation of funds they inform consecrate and reproduce a disciplinary center that, in contrast to the periphery, is well-endowed with grants and research staff, decides in panels over the quality standards of the field, and publishes a high number of articles in high-impact journals. This selectivity is oriented toward previous distributions of resources and a standardized notion of ``excellence'' rather than research performance.},

First, we unveil two modes of ranking critique, one drawing attention to negative effects, the other to methodological shortcomings. Second, we explore how rankers respond to these challenges, showing that they either deflect criticism with a variety of defensive responses or that they respond confidently by drawing attention to the strengths of university rankings. In the last step, we examine mutual engagements between rankers and critics that are based on the entwinement of methodological critique and confident responses. While the way rankers respond to criticism generally explains how rankings continue to flourish, it is precisely the ongoing conversation with critics that facilitates what we coin the discursive resilience of university rankings. The prevalence of university rankings is, in other words, a product of the mutual discursive work of their proponents and opponents.},

  abstract = {Exploring the `globalization' of the social sciences, this article first presents an historical interpretation of how transnational exchange in the social sciences has evolved. Earlier forms of international circulation are distinct from the more global arrangements that have emerged since the late twentieth century. Considering this globalizing field in more detail, it is argued that its predominant characteristic is a core--periphery structure, with a duopolistic Euro-American core, multiple semi-peripheries and a wide range of peripheries. Focusing on the global level, much of the existing research, however, has neglected the emergence of transnational regional structures. The formation of a transnational European field of social science is taken as an example of this process of transnational regionalization. The social sciences worldwide can thus be seen as a four-level structure. In addition to the local and national level, transnational regional as well as global structures have gained increasing importance and a better understanding of `globalization' requires more precise studies of both levels, in their own right as well as in their evolving interconnectedness.},

This paper seeks to find general lessons in the accumulated experience with PRFSs that can serve to enrich our understanding of how research policy and innovation systems are evolving. The paper also links the PRFS experience with the public management literature, particularly new public management, and understanding of public sector performance evaluation systems. PRFSs were found to be complex, dynamic systems, balancing peer review and metrics, accommodating differences between fields, and involving lengthy consultation with the academic community and transparency in data and results. Although the importance of PRFSs seems based on their distribution of universities' research funding, this is something of an illusion, and the literature agrees that it is the competition for prestige created by a PRSF that creates powerful incentives within university systems. The literature suggests that under the right circumstances a PRFS will enhance control by professional elites. PRFSs since they aim for excellence, may compromise other important values such as equity or diversity. They will not serve the goal of enhancing the economic relevance of research.},

The book is written as a non-technical introduction, intended for the advanced undergraduate level and onwards.MCA represents and models data sets as clouds of points in a multidimensional Euclidean space. The interpretation of the data is based on these clouds of points. In seven chapters, this non-technical book will provide the reader with a comprehensive introduction and the needed knowledge to do analyses on his/her own: CA, MCA, specific MCA, the integration of MCA and variance analysis, of MCA and ascending hierarchical cluster analysis and class-specific MCA on subgroups. Special attention will be given to the construction of social spaces, to the construction of typologies and to group internal oppositions.This is a book on data analysis for the social sciences rather than a book on statistics. The main emphasis is on how to apply MCA to the analysis of practical research questions. It does not require a solid understanding of statistics and/or mathematics, and provides the reader with the needed knowledge to do analyses on his/her own.},

Media rankings deliberately draw attention to the performance of each university relative to all others, and as such they are undeniably simple to use and interpret. But one danger is that they are potentially open to manipulation and gaming because many of the measures underlying the rankings are under the control of the institutions themselves. This paper examines media rankings (constructed from an amalgamation of variables representing performance across numerous dimensions) to reveal the problems with using a composite index to reflect overall performance. It ends with a proposal for an alternative methodology which leads to groupings rather than point estimates.},

  abstract = {University rankings have led to the following paradox. On one hand, global and national university rankings have an increasing impact on scientific research and higher education. On the other hand, a growing number of researchers have argued that university rankings are biased and methodologically flawed as well as documented their unintended consequences that are counterproductive to education and research activities in universities. In this article, I combine sociological and cognitive perspectives to develop a theoretical framework for explaining this paradox. The theoretical framework has four interrelated parts. The first is a distinction between three temporal stages through which university rankings commensurate universities. The second consists of an account of the social mechanisms through which university rankings generate reactive outcomes that tend to transform universities instead of just measuring their quality. The third is a league table metaphor that links the conceptual domain of team sports and the conceptual domain of universities and, I argue, provides a cognitive mechanism that shapes how many extra-academic actors, such as prospective students and policymakers, understand the results of university rankings. The fourth focuses on the affordances of the published league tables of university rankings that many extraacademic actors use for outsourcing part of their decision-making to the league tables. As a whole, this framework allows us to understand how the interrelated and materially mediated actions of different groups of actors give rise to and sustain the paradox of university rankings.},

But times have changed. Today, a new elite of boys and girls is being molded at St. Paul's, one that reflects the hope of openness but also the persistence of inequality.  In \emph{Privilege} , Shamus Khan returns to his alma mater to provide an inside look at an institution that has been the private realm of the elite for the past 150 years. He shows that St. Paul's students continue to learn what they always have--how to embody privilege. Yet, while students once leveraged the trappings of upper-class entitlement, family connections, and high culture, current St. Paul's students learn to succeed in a more diverse environment. To be the future leaders of a more democratic world, they must be at ease with everything from highbrow art to everyday life--from \emph{Beowulf} to \emph{Jaws} --and view hierarchies as ladders to scale. Through deft portrayals of the relationships among students, faculty, and staff, Khan shows how members of the new elite face the opening of society while still preserving the advantages that allow them to rule.},

  abstract = {Class does make a difference in the lives and futures of American children. Drawing on in-depth observations of black and white middle-class, working-class, and poor families, Unequal Childhoods explores this fact, offering a picture of childhood today. Here are the frenetic families managing their children's hectic schedules of "leisure" activities; and here are families with plenty of time but little economic security. Lareau shows how middle-class parents, whether black or white, engage in a process of "concerted cultivation" designed to draw out children's talents and skills, while working-class and poor families rely on "the accomplishment of natural growth," in which a child's development unfolds spontaneously---as long as basic comfort, food, and shelter are provided. Each of these approaches to childrearing brings its own benefits and its own drawbacks. In identifying and analyzing differences between the two, Lareau demonstrates the power, and limits, of social class in shaping the lives of America's children. The first edition of Unequal Childhoods was an instant classic, portraying in riveting detail the unexpected ways in which social class influences parenting in white and African American families. A decade later, Annette Lareau has revisited the same families and interviewed the original subjects to examine the impact of social class in the transition to adulthood.},

  abstract = {One sociologist who has been particularly central to the development of International Political Sociology (IPS) is Pierre Bourdieu and his reflexive sociology. It is somewhat surprising given that Bourdieu was not especially attuned to international studies himself. His impact on IPS is instead via reinterpretations of his conceptual apparatus by other researchers, many of whom who have been involved in the IPS project from its outset. These post-Bourdieusian scholars have deployed reflexive sociology to explore transnational fields situated at the crossroads of the international and the national. By taking a resolutely sociological starting-point, they have provided a very different reading of the international. They have reconstructed the symbolic categories of transnational fields and notably the importance of the national modes of production vis-{\`a}-vis the production of in the making of the international. This theoretical apparatus has also been used as tools for visualising --or mapping -- the international in terms of a set of specific transnational fields. The chapter concentrate on the two key notions of post-Bourdieuian IPS scholarship: reflexivity and transnational fields. They are both illustrated with examples drawn from empirical studies of transnational forms of power, elite structuration of the global and question related to transnational professionals. Although it is tempting to present this approach in a more condensed version, readymade for an IR audience in search of only minor adjustments in the division of labour between soft constructivism and mainstream realism, the paper to guard the originality of the approach. It is the overall argument that the post-Bourdieuian approaches to the object of IR provide a very different look at the international as it assembles the international in a different deeply sociological fashion than most IR approaches.},

Like all economy the global knowledge economy is a site of production. It is also social and cultural, taking the form of a one-world community mediated by the web. The k-economy has developed with extraordinary rapidity, particularly the open source component; which, consistent with the economic character of knowledge as a public good, appears larger than the commercial intellectual property component. But how do the chaotic open source flows of knowledge, with no evident tendency towards predictability let alone towards equilibrium, become reconciled with a world of governments, economic markets, national and university hierarchies, and institutions that routinely require stability and control in order to function? The article argues that in the k-economy, knowledge flows are vectored by a system of status production that assigns unequal values to knowledge and arranges it in ordered patterns. The new system for regulating the value of public good knowledge includes institutional league tables, research rankings, publication and citation metrics, journal hierarchies, and other comparative output measures such as outcomes of student learning.},

  abstract = {University rankings widely affect the behaviours of prospective students and their families, university executive leaders, academic faculty, governments and investors in higher education. Yet the social science foundations of global rankings receive little scrutiny. Rankings that simply recycle reputation without any necessary connection to real outputs are of no common value. It is necessary that rankings be soundly based in scientific terms if a virtuous relationship between performance and ranking is to be established, the worst potentials of rankings are to be constrained, and rankings are optimised as a source of comparative information. This article evaluates six ranking systems, Shanghai ARWU, Leiden University, QS, Scopus, Times Higher Education and U-Multirank, according to six social science criteria and two behavioural criteria. The social science criteria are materiality (rankings must be grounded in the observable higher education world), objectivity (opinion surveys should not be used), externality (ranked universities should not be a source of data about themselves), comprehensiveness (rankings should cover the broadest possible range of functions), particularity (ranking systems should eschew multi-indicators with weights, or proxy measures) and ordinal proportionality (vertical distinctions between universities should not be exaggerated). The behavioural criteria are the alignment of the ranking with tendencies to improved performance of all institutions and countries, and transparency, meaning accessibility to strategy making designed to maximize institutional position. The pure research rankings rate well overall but lack comprehensiveness. U-Multirank is also strong under most criteria but stymied by its 100 per cent reliance on subjective data collected via survey.},

The development of the concept is outlined to present Bourdieu's understanding of higher education as a field consisting of cognitive and structural mechanisms that mediate sociopolitical and economic forces while simultaneously reproducing fundamental principles of social stratification. As an illustration of its widespread application, Bourdieu's framework is applied to develop an analytical understanding of institutional strategies developed by South African universities during a period of political instability. Drawing insights from the South African case study and Bourdieu's empirical research, the article concludes that Bourdieu's theory may be seen to have transcended more simplistic conceptions of universities as closed systems detached from the sociopolitical complex or as mere reflections of external power relations. However, the strict relational nature of Bourdieu's framework and his concept of the 'arbitrary' have placed limits on the extent to which his theory can offer a more in-depth account of the relationship between higher education and society.},

Setting the scene in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), a postcolonial city reverted to the rule of the People's Republic of China (PRC) in 1997, this paper aims to develop a critical sociology of HPE by having a dialogue among Continental philosophies (e.g., Bourdieu) and Chinese philosophies around embodiment concepts. Although HKSAR is a complex meeting point of Eastern and Western ideologies, the current HPE field tends to focus on Western and 'scientific' ways of knowing, such as the measurement of health and physical fitness, and often at the expense of sociocultural perspectives, social justice and diversity and inclusion in HPE. In other words, the (post) positivistic research paradigm underpins the HPE field. This paper argues that in order to reap the benefits of a more holistic health education for academics and students in HPE, it is vital to de-imperialise the positivistic ways of teaching and being in HPE. In doing so, this paper creates a space for Bourdieu's habitus to meet Chinese perspectives on embodiment to engage in a dialogue for knowledge production that extends the current knowledge base in HPE.},

Administrators have periodically evaluated the research of most full-time academics employed in British universities, seeking to distribute increasingly scarce funding to those who use it best. How do such attempts to quantify the worth of knowledge change the nature of scholarship?Juan Pablo Pardo-Guerra examines the effects of quantitative research evaluations on British social scientists, arguing that the mission to measure academic excellence resulted in less diversity and more disciplinary conformity. Combining interviews and original computational analyses, The Quantified Scholar provides a compelling account of how scores, metrics, and standardized research evaluations altered the incentives of scientists and administrators by rewarding forms of scholarship that were closer to established disciplinary canons. In doing so, research evaluations amplified publication hierarchies and long-standing forms of academic prestige to the detriment of diversity. Slowly but surely, they reshaped academic departments, the interests of scholars, the organization of disciplines, and the employment conditions of researchers.Critiquing the effects of quantification on the workplace, this book also presents alternatives to existing forms of evaluation, calling for new forms of vocational solidarity that can challenge entrenched inequality in academia.},

Kazakhstan, the only Central Asian member of the European Higher Education Area, is no exception as it too aspires to have a world-class university. This paper examines the policies of the Kazakhstani government towards a recently founded institution, Nazarbayev University, as it seeks to position Kazakhstan as a credible global knowledge economy, but also use the university as a means of fulfilling domestic nation-building objectives. Addressing the policy challenges of creating a world-class university in this particular Central Asian context, the paper contributes to a reshaping of our understanding of how certain states currently outside the global `core' are using higher education as a neoliberal development strategy. This paper offers the prospect that there might not just be multiple paths to the creation of a world-class university, but also multiple interpretations of what it means to be a world-class university.},

In contrast, this paper examines three issues with the example of three well known rankings (Shanghai, Times and Taiwan). First, on which methods, in particular on which indicators are they based? Second, are there fundamental deficits of concept and systematic biases? Third, can one predict good or bad ranking scores, based on the respective concept? In addition with the example of German universities there are two factors on performance measurement discussed, disciplinary cultures and size of the university. In sum, the usefulness of global rankings is considered to be highly questionable. Measures in science policy should not be legitimated with such rankings.},

  abstract = {The spread of the principles and techniques of financial accounting into new systems for measuring, ranking, and auditing performance represents one of the most important and defining features of contemporary governance. Audit procedures are redefining accountability, transparency, and good governance and reshaping the way organizations and individuals have to operate. They also undermine professional autonomy and have unanticipated and dysfunctional consequences. Taking up the concept of audit culture as an analytical framework, we examine the origins, spread, and rationality driving these new financialized techniques of governance, not least through the work of the Big Four accountancy firms, and trace their impact across a number of fields, from administration and the military to business corporations and universities. We ask, what new kinds of ethics of accountability does audit produce? Building on Mitchell (1999), Strathern (2000a), Trouillot (2001), and Merry (2011), we identify how the techniques and logics of financial accountancy have five audit effects. These are ``domaining,'' ``classificatory,'' ``individualizing and totalizing,'' ``governance,'' and ``perverse'' effects. We conclude by reflecting on the problems of audit culture and suggest ways to reclaim the professional values and democratic spaces that are being eroded by these new systems of governing by numbers.},

The purpose is to develop an understanding of the processes of internationalization and to apply this understanding in a critical examination of two often used general criteria in research evaluations in the SSH. One of them is that the coverage of a publication in Scopus or Web of Science is seen in itself as an expression of research quality and of internationalization. The other is that a specific international language, English, and a specific type of publication, journal articles, are perceived as supreme in a general hierarchy of languages and publication types. Simple distinctions based on these criteria are contrary to the heterogeneous publication patterns needed in the SSH to organize their research adequately, present their results properly, reach their audiences efficiently, and thereby fulfil their missions. Research quality, internationalization, and societal relevance can be promoted in research assessment in the SSH without categorical hierarchies of publications. I will demonstrate this by using data from scholarly publishing in the SSH that go beyond the coverage in the commercial data sources in order to give a more comprehensive representation of scholarly publishing in the SSH.},

  abstract = {Joel Spring investigates the role of educational policy in the evolving global economy, and the consequences of school systems around the world adapting to meet the needs of international corporations. The new global model for education addresses problems of technological change, the quick exchange of capital, and free markets; policies to resolve these problems include "lifelong learning," "learning societies," international and national accreditation of work skills; international and national standards and tests; school choice; multiculturalism; and economic nationalism.   The distinctive contribution Spring makes is to offer an original interpretive framework for examining and understanding the interconnections among education, imperialism and colonialism, and the rise of the global economy. He offers a unique comparison of the educational policies of the World Bank, the United Nations, the European Union, and the Organization for Economic Development and Cooperation.   Additionally, he provides and weaves together important historical and current information on education in the context of the expansion of international capitalism; much of this information, gathered from many diverse sources, is otherwise not easily available to readers of this book. In the concluding chapters of the volume, Spring presents a thoughtful analysis and a powerful argument emphasizing the importance of human rights education in a global economy.   This volume is a sequel to Spring's earlier book, Education and the Rise of the Corporate State (1972), continuing the work he has been engaged in since the 1970s to describe and analyze the relationship between political, economic, and historical forces and educational policy.},

  abstract = {Chile has experienced considerable educational expansion over the past few decades, as well as a privatization reform in 1981 that introduced full parental choice through a voucher system, in the context of a market-oriented transformation of the country. Using a cohort analysis of the 2001 Chilean Mobility Survey, this article examines trends in educational stratification in Chile over the past 50 years, with a focus on the changes that followed the privatization reform. The analysis shows that, in line with international findings, there is ``persistent inequality'' of educational opportunity across cohorts in Chile. Persistent inequality is not total, however. There is a small but significant increase in inequality in the transition to secondary education, which is cotemporaneous with the market-oriented transformation. Furthermore, when school sector-a form of ``qualitative inequality'' expressed in the distinction among public, private-voucher, and private-paid schools-is considered, the analysis suggests an increase in the advantages that are associated with private-voucher schools after the privatization reform, as well as in the benefits of attending private-paid schools during and after the reform. The article concludes by discussing the relationship among economic context, privatization reform, and educational inequality.},

Besides methodological issues, in this chapter I will give attention to the impacts these rankings have, including U-Multirank. As the findings regarding impacts turn out to be not unequivocally positive, should we stop producing or reading them --- will there be a fall of rankings?},
